# Fast Fourier Transform Sandbox
The code was written in a span few hours so *please be gentle*.

I didn't bother making logo for this one. Sorry.

## Instructions
I did bother to make a visual instruction tho... Interesting

The base waves are sinusoids not cosines, that's why there is a phase shift of -Ï€/2 by default.
